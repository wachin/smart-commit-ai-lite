# Roadmap: NLTK + Lightweight ML Git Commit Generator

This roadmap tracks the progress of the NLTK-based smart commit generator, now extended with a mandatory classic scikit-learn ML engine. The goal is to improve Conventional Commit prediction without turning the project into a heavy AI application: everything should stay local, lightweight, explainable, maintainable, and Debian 12 friendly.

## Project Contract

### Philosophy
- [x] Keep the project lightweight, offline-first, open source, Linux friendly, Debian 12 friendly, and low-resource friendly.
- [x] Prioritize stability, offline compatibility, Debian compatibility, low memory usage, and then accuracy.
- [x] Keep `smart_commit_nltk.py` functional as the existing heuristic engine.
- [x] Extend the current architecture instead of replacing it.
- [x] Avoid unnecessary complexity and heavy dependencies.

### Technical Boundaries
- [x] Do not use transformers, torch, tensorflow, spaCy, Hugging Face, neural networks, cloud APIs, LLM frameworks, online inference, or telemetry.
- [x] Use dependencies available in Debian 12 repositories: `python3-nltk`, `python3-sklearn`, `python3-joblib`, `python3-langdetect`, and `python3-regex`.
- [x] Keep `python3-gensim` optional, not required.
- [x] Do not depend on heavy pip-only packages for the main path.
- [x] Keep the application fully usable without internet access once local NLTK data and, if used, the local model are present.

### Engine Responsibilities
- [x] NLTK and local utilities: normalization, cleanup, tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, and preprocessing.
- [x] scikit-learn: TF-IDF vectorization, ML classification, and commit type prediction.
- [x] `smart_commit_nltk.py`: orchestrator for NLTK preprocessing -> sklearn classification -> NLTK/heuristic subject and body generation.
- [x] Existing heuristics: scope detection, subject/body generation, and compatibility with the current UI behavior.
- [x] `python3-langdetect`: support language detection when useful, with deterministic behavior.
- [x] `python3-regex`: improve regular-expression handling where useful.

### ML Objective
- [x] Predict Conventional Commit types from user text.
- [x] Support these types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, and `chore`.
- [x] Use `TfidfVectorizer` and `LinearSVC`.
- [x] Save the model locally with `joblib`.
- [x] Save the vectorizer separately.
- [x] Load quickly from the distributed local model artifacts.
- [x] Avoid online inference and external services.

## Current State

The program is already usable for daily work: it accepts pasted English or Spanish text, removes Markdown/command noise, detects language, proposes `type(scope)`, generates a localized subject and body, lets the user manually correct language/type/scope, and copies the command without a modal dialog.

The current improvement track is not Git integration. It is better semantic quality from pasted text. The ML layer is mandatory, classic, and local; `smart_commit_nltk.py` orchestrates the hybrid flow instead of being replaced by it.

### Latest Important Progress
- [x] Removed the separate subject/body preview because it did not improve the workflow.
- [x] Added word-boundary-aware subject truncation.
- [x] Fixed prioritization so semantic changes are not hidden by secondary test or documentation mentions.
- [x] Added detection for indirect validation phrases such as `Result: 20 tests OK`, `full suite passes`, `py_compile`, `compileall`, `unittest`, and `pytest`.
- [x] Added file mention detection to classify code, tests, documentation, reports, and configuration.
- [x] Expanded the body from 5 to 7 bullets to preserve important details.
- [x] Added bullet ranking so main changes come first, tests/docs/reports follow, and validation stays last.
- [x] Added a hybrid ML architecture with scikit-learn, TF-IDF, LinearSVC, and NLTK/heuristic orchestration.
- [x] Current suite: 54 registered tests, 53 passing in this environment, and 1 training test reserved for Debian sklearn validation.

### ML Prompt Compliance Status
- [x] `smart_commit_nltk.py` remains present and functional.
- [x] The sklearn engine is modular and part of the standard architecture.
- [x] Add startup validation for the distributed `ml/commit_model.pkl` and `ml/vectorizer.pkl` artifacts.
- [x] Validate `ml/model_metadata.json` format and required fields before treating the distributed model as ready.
- [x] Training reuses `commit_examples_data/examples.json`, `commit_examples_data/examples.db`, and `commit_examples_data/entries/`.
- [x] The predictor returns a type and approximate confidence when the model supports it.
- [x] The system supports English and Spanish input.
- [x] The project includes `ml/`, `utils/`, and dedicated tests for the new architecture.
- [x] Product decision: distribute a pre-trained model while keeping local retraining available for users who need it.
- [ ] Validate real training and predictions on Debian 12 with `python3-sklearn` installed.
- [ ] Distribute a pre-trained model, vectorizer, and metadata file; document how users can retrain locally as needed.

### Current Quality Example

Input summary:

```text
I improved file mention detection in pasted text.
I updated smart_commit_nltk.py, tests/test_smart_commit_nltk.py, README.md,
Roadmap.md, and commit_examples_data/comparison_report.json.
Result: 19 tests OK.
```

Current expected output:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(nlp): improve file mention detection" \
  -m "- Update code paths mentioned in the summary" \
  -m "- Cover changes with regression tests" \
  -m "- Update documentation mentioned in the summary" \
  -m "- Update evaluation data or reports" \
  -m "- Validation: 19 tests pass"
```

### Useful Commands

Install Debian dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install \
    python3-pyqt6 \
    python3-nltk \
    python3-sklearn \
    python3-joblib \
    python3-langdetect \
    python3-regex
```

Optional dependency:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gensim
```

Train or retrain the local ML model:

```bash
python3 -m ml.train_model
```

Run the regression suite:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Recalculate the comparison report:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python3 commit_examples_data/compare_generator.py
```

Note: `__pycache__/smart_commit_nltk.cpython-311.pyc` may appear modified because it is already tracked by Git. `.gitignore` prevents new generated artifacts, but removing that tracked bytecode from the index remains pending.

## Future Improvements

### Recommended Next Session
- [x] Test the program with the latest Codex-generated summary and compare it against the commit a richer AI would produce.
- [x] Added a regression for ML metadata validation summaries so they generate `feat(ml)` instead of generic style/docs output.
- [ ] If the subject is too generic, add a specific subject rule before touching the body.
- [ ] If the body has good bullets but poor ordering, adjust `rank_body_lines()`.
- [ ] If useful information is lost from pasted text, inspect `clean_input()` first.
- [ ] After each improvement, add or adjust a regression test in `tests/test_smart_commit_nltk.py`.
- [ ] Always run `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.

### [ ] Evaluation and Testing
- [x] Add more unit tests for Spanish action extraction.
- [x] Add more unit tests for `select_commit_type()` and `detect_scope()`.
- [ ] Add ML prediction tests with the distributed trained model in a Debian 12 apt environment.

- [x] Verify prompt examples: crash/audio -> `fix`, MIDI karaoke -> `feat`, instructions -> `docs`, deprecated code -> `refactor`.
- [x] Add regression cases for mixed English/Spanish texts.
- [x] Add regression cases for summaries with several modified files.
- [x] Define new metrics that do not penalize the current 7-bullet limit.
- [ ] Improve historical dataset metrics without losing recent bilingual cases.

### [ ] ML Engine and Data

- [x] Measure local model accuracy without increasing weight or complexity.
- [x] Document when to regenerate `commit_model.pkl`, `vectorizer.pkl`, and `model_metadata.json`.

**Last updated:** May 12, 2026  
**Status:** Functional for basic use and daily iteration. It now has initial regressions, dataset evaluation, and a documented mandatory offline NLTK + sklearn architecture. The next priority is improving semantic quality from pasted text without losing lightness or Debian compatibility.
